**Task description:**
Work further in the project we have created now with semantic HTML and CSS location Flex. But in this task,  will focus on the user journey and analyze how the website's structure and layout can be improved to provide an optimal experience so that whoever will use your page gets the most out of the content. 

**Consider the following questions:**

**Who**: Who is your target audience? How can the layout and structure adapt to the users' needs?
**What**: What should the website convey or offer? Make sure the information is logically organized and easily accessible.
**Where**: Where on the page should different elements be placed to be intuitive and easily accessible?

**Claim:**

Continue to use semantic elements, such as header, main, section, nav, and footer to build up the website in a structured and understandable way. 

Elements such as div and span can be used where there is no semantic alternative

CSS Flex for page layout. Think about how the elements should be positioned and adapted to different screen sizes to improve the user experience.

Use the analysis method we've gone through to see how other websites are structured.

Let yourself be inspired by how they have used flex and organized the content to meet their users' needs.

**Bonus:**

Add a link in the navigation that takes you to other parts of the website. (Hint: Here you have to search for anchor tags and link bookmarks)
Add shadows to create depth on your website. (Hint: Here you have to search for box-shadow, and possibly text-shadow based on where you want shadows)
